# CodeCrafter - Online C++ Compiler and Execution Platform

CodeCrafter is an online platform that empowers users to write, compile, and execute C++ code directly through a web interface. It also displays the output results of the executed code. Similar to existing online compilers like [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/), our website offers a user-friendly environment for programming enthusiasts, learners, and professionals to practice C++ programming without the need for local development tools.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive web-based user interface for code input.
2. **Enhanced Code Editing:** Implement a code editor with features like syntax highlighting and code auto-completion.
3. **Secure Code Execution:** Develop a secure back-end system for compiling and executing C++ code submissions in a controlled, sandboxed environment.
4. **Output Display:** Show the output and any error messages generated during code execution.
5. **Data Storage:** Securely store user-submitted code and execution results in a database.
6. **Security Measures:** Implement input validation, code sandboxing, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the website on a suitable hosting platform with secure connections (HTTPS).

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js for a responsive and interactive interface.
- **Back-end:** Node.js with Express for handling user requests, Python for sandboxing, and PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Compiler Integration:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for C++ code compilation.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Extensive testing will ensure the correctness and security of the platform. Unit testing will verify individual components, while user testing will assess usability and performance.

## Deployment and Maintenance

The website will be hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) with proper server configuration, domain setup, and SSL certificate for secure connections. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be performed to address issues, keep software up to date, and improve scalability and user experience.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

We prioritize ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations to protect user data and ensure responsible use of the platform.

## Conclusion

CodeCrafter aims to provide a valuable online resource for individuals interested in learning and practicing C++ programming. It combines a user-friendly interface with secure code execution capabilities, making it a useful tool for both beginners and experienced programmers.
