**Introduction:**
The project aims to develop an online platform that provides users with the ability to write, compile, and execute C++ code directly through a web interface. The platform will also display the output results of the executed code. Similar to existing online compilers, such as "https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/," our website will offer a user-friendly environment for programming enthusiasts, learners, and professionals to practice C++ programming without the need for local development tools.

**Objectives:**

1. Create a web-based user interface for code input, making it intuitive and user-friendly.
2. Implement a code editor with features like syntax highlighting and code auto-completion to enhance the coding experience.
3. Develop a secure back-end system that can compile and execute C++ code submissions from users.
4. Integrate with a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) and execute user code in a controlled, sandboxed environment to ensure security.
5. Display the output and any error messages generated during code execution.
6. Store user-submitted code and execution results securely in a database.
7. Implement security measures such as input validation, code sandboxing, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
8. Deploy the website on a suitable hosting platform with secure connections (HTTPS).

**Technology Stack:**

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js for a responsive and interactive interface.
- Back-end: Node.js with Express for handling user requests, Python for sandboxing, and PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Integration with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for C++ code compilation.

**Testing and Quality Assurance:**
Extensive testing will be conducted to ensure the platform's correctness and security. Unit testing will verify the functionality of individual components, while user testing will assess the overall usability and performance.

**Deployment and Maintenance:**
The website will be hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) with proper server configuration, domain setup, and SSL certificate for secure connections. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be performed to address any issues, keep software up to date, and improve scalability and user experience.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**
We will adhere to ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations to protect user data and ensure responsible use of the platform.

**Conclusion:**
The project aims to provide a valuable online resource for individuals interested in learning and practicing C++ programming. It combines a user-friendly interface with secure code execution capabilities, making it a useful tool for both beginners and experienced programmers.
